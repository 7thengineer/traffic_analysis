### Project Title
Traffic Analysis - Flow/Density

### Description
This project makes use of computer vision techniques based on open CV2 and Yolo-V3 to identify, track and analyse traffic data from a traffic camera video stream. The original source code was gotten from pyimagesearch and modified to suit the specific needs of the application area.

The program takes in a traffic feed, iterates through the frames, and generates a live feed showing the tracked vehicles and traffic analysis information

The libraries adopted in this project are

numpy
argparse
imutils
time
cv2
os
dlib
pandas as pd
matplotlib.pyplot as plt

### Files used
The files used for the project are;
CentroidTracker.py
TrackableObject.py
TrackableObject2.py
TrackableObject3.py
TrackableObject4.py
Yolo-coco Folder

### Credits
